# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview
This README is the central entry point for the OctoAcme Project Management documentation. It summarizes key principles and links to all detailed process docs.

## Project Management Processes — Summary
OctoAcme's project management framework is:
- Customer-first, iterative, and data-informed
- Structured around a lifecycle: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Continuous Improvement
- Roles (PM, PdM, Developers, QA, Stakeholders) are clearly defined for ownership and accountability
- Transparency, alignment, and regular communication are prioritized using key artifacts (One-pager, Roadmap, Backlog, Risk Register, etc.)
